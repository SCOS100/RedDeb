# What is RedDeb?

RedDeb is a name created by @PolMartDetera on Telegram (thank you), and it is called like that because, as the name suggests, it doesn't only run on a singular device, even though some tweaks are needed, and it runs down the family of Xiaomi phones and Xiaomi sub-company made phones (such as Redmi, Mi and POCO phones) (and maybe some others).

It works by utilizing the Android boot.img to load a custom initramfs that then loads a premade environment created in the Android Data directory or SD-Card. This works because Android, as a base, uses Linux, and Linux is very versatile, being able to boot multiple OS's with a single kernel.

The nice thing about RedDeb is that, unlike other Linux OS's for Android Smartphones, it natively runs as a dual-boot next to Android thanks to the A/B Partitioning Scheme.
